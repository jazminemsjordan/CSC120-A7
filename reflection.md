- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I actually really enjoyed working with inheritance. I appreciate how it cut out redundancy and made the whole process of coding less repetitive when I can just inherit shared methods. Maybe it's a sign of increased confidence in programming, but I felt like this assignment was pretty straightforward overall. I'd say the part I had the most trouble with was the printCollection method for the library. It was more open-ended in how we should format the list, so I had to think about how I wanted to approach it. I ended up settling on what I thought was the neatest, if not most efficient, way to format the collection: I removed the brackets that come with the hashtable, turned it into an array, and iterated over it so each book and author would be printed on a new line.


Revision log: 
    - changed constructor order for house with hasDiningRoom at end
    - swapped "contains" for "containsKey" method to properly check for a title in the library inventory
    - throws exception if trying to check out an already checked out book
